#### Exercise 1.33
Write the signature for a method named `send` that has one parameter of type
`String`, and does not return a value.

> **Assistant's note:** If you feel confused about what a method signature
> should look like, you are not alone, because the authors of _Objects First
> with Java_ are too! In the 5th edition, the definition on page 7 is
> **incorrect**. This has been fixed in the 6th edition, but they have left out
> a concrete example and mix it up again later in the book. For the correct
> definition with example, see
> [Defining Methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html)
> from Oracle's Java documentation. Both versions will be accepted, but do note
> that it is the one from the Oracle documentation that is actually correct.

#### Exercise 1.34
